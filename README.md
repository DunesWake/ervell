# Ervell

Front-end Are.na client, built using Artsy's [Ezel](https://github.com/artsy/ezel). Also, made possible by Artsy's very generous decision to open source their front-end client. Many patterns (also bits of code, probably) adopted from [Force](https://github.com/artsy/force-public). Thanks y'all.

The general idea here is something minimal, utilitarian, unobtrusive and adaptible to many different situations. We try to make use of re-usable components and views as often as possible.

### Getting Started (Local)

* Fork this repo
* Install [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) or [Forego](https://github.com/ddollar/forego)
* Obtain a set of .env files (.env.dev, .env.staging, .env.prod) from [@dzucconi](https://github.com/dzucconi) or [@broskoski](https://github.com/broskoski)
* Install [Yarn](http://brewformulas.org/Yarn)
* Install dependencies: `yarn install`

### Running the server

```bash
  foreman start -f Procfile.dev -e .env.dev
  # => Listening on port 5000
```

You can point at different instances using different .env files (local/staging/prod).
